From the board in Mikes office

Correctness:
 - assume empty log, OR, start with exiting log
 - run log append with key, N times
 - query
 - expected output

Secrecy:
 - assume log with no key or transcript for the log
 - query with key OR query response from stdout
 - expected output should match in either case

Integrity:
 - assume log with no key, but with transcript
 - provide substitute log file 
 - query with original key should produce different output
