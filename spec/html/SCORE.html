<h1>Scoring</h1>
<h2>Build-it Round</h2>
<p>Base points are awarded for implementations that meet a minimum level
of functionality. Optional points are awarded for implementing
optional features in <code>logread</code>. Performance points are awarded for
smaller output size (as measured by summing the byte content of the
log path) and shorter running time on log append and log parsing.
Shorter times and smaller size is better. Precise scoring information is
