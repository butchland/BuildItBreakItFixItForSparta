Incorrect HTML in first table (see STATE_HTML.html).
When the number of employees is not the same with the number of guests, the number of rows in the table should be the largest of the two, with some possible empty cells in the other table.
This submission omits the empty cells towards the end of the table. Thus, the number of <td> elements per row varies, which is incorrect and ugly.
