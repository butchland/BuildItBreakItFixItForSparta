Integrity violation: Team 47's encryption methodology may be susceptible to a simple brute-force attack on the hash value of the supplied encryption token.

See Line 35 of securelog.py

The key is passed in as the random seed to random.Random(key).randrange.  Python hashes the key value to an integer between (-sys.maxint -1) and sys.maxint.

I am currently attempting to brute-force crack a small log file using the script team47_bug4_decode.py -- should this be successful I will also submit an XML file for validation.
