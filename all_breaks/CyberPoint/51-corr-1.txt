Placing a statement with the wrong password in a batch file, 
and then trying to run that file with logappend, causes 
a memory error and crash.

Note that the XML didn't seem to have a clear way to run commands
with batch files. The code that should be in the batch file is
the single line: 

    -K notpass -T 2 -A -E Mike newlog
